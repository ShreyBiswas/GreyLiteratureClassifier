In another randomised, replicated, controlled experiment, grazing intensities of brent geese were similar in sheep-grazed (59.6 total droppings/m²) and cattle-grazed (60.2 droppings/m²) plots. In the first experiment, grazed plots contained sheep in April-May or June and July-September and grazing intensities varied from 13.5-92.2 livestock unit days. Cut and grazed plots were cut on 26 June then grazed for one or two one-month periods. Cut plots were cut in late June and late August. Each treatment was replicated six times in 100 x 75 m plots. In the second experiment six plots (of 50 x 50 m) were grazed by 14 cattle and six plots were grazed by 6-11 sheep in June-August.

Vegetation was cut and removed by the local authority. Prior to this management Cleaver Pond, and nearby Marigold Pond (approximately 400 m away and not subjected to vegetation removal), were subject to physical and biological surveys.   Smooth newt censuses: Night-time censuses were undertaken during the breeding seasons in 1985 and 1986 i.e. before and after the vegetation removal. Commencing in March, two or three visits per week between 19:30 to 11:00 h (starting at or around dusk) were made. In 1985 visits were terminated in mid-June, and in 1986 early July. At Marigold Pond in both years a census consisted of walking around the pond perimeter, scanning the shallower and less-vegetated areas with a spotlight and recording the number of newts observed. At Cleaver Pond with limited access in 1985, only a small area at the western end was accessible due to thick vegetation surrounding the pond elsewhere. During each visit, standing at the western end, the number of newts visible over a 10 minute period was recorded.

Vegetation was cut and removed by the local authority. Prior to this management Cleaver Pond, and nearby Marigold Pond (approximately 400 m away and not subjected to vegetation removal), were subject to physical and biological surveys.   Smooth newt censuses: Night-time censuses were undertaken during the breeding seasons in 1985 and 1986 i.e. before and after the vegetation removal. Commencing in March, two or three visits per week between 19:30 to 11:00 h (starting at or around dusk) were made. In 1985 visits were terminated in mid-June, and in 1986 early July. At Marigold Pond in both years a census consisted of walking around the pond perimeter, scanning the shallower and less-vegetated areas with a spotlight and recording the number of newts observed. At Cleaver Pond with limited access in 1985, only a small area at the western end was accessible due to thick vegetation surrounding the pond elsewhere. During each visit, standing at the western end, the number of newts visible over a 10 minute period was recorded. In 1986, access to Cleaver Pond was greatly improved but the same census technique was employed as in 1985.In England, several studies have shown that ponds with marginal scrub habitat are more likely to support amphibian populations than those without. Loss of terrestrial habitat surrounding ponds can be detrimental to amphibians which use ponds for breeding. An opportunity to study the effects of removal of marginal vegetation on a population of smooth newts Triturus vulgaris arose when scrub clearance was undertaken around a pond in Buckinghamshire, southern England.Note: If using or referring to this published study please read and quote the original paper.\"}"

Goose grazing intensity was not affected by sheep grazing compared to cattle grazing. Six replicates of each treatment were used.Employ grazing in artificial grasslands/pasturesUse grazing instead of cutting for pasture or grassland managementA series of replicated controlled trials on grassland sites at two reserves in Essex, England, between 1990 and 1992 (Vickery et al. 1994) found that brent geese Branta bernicla grazed at significantly higher densities on fertilised and cut areas, compared to unfertilised areas, but only at high levels of fertiliser application (50 kg N/ha used: 28-30 droppings/m2 for fertilised areas vs. 23-28 droppings/m2 for controls; 18 kg N/ha\\xa0 used: 30-35 droppings/m2 for fertilised areas vs. 25-35 droppings/m2 for control areas). There were no differences between trials using organic and inorganic fertiliser.\\xa0Fertilize artificial grasslands A series of replicated trials on grassland sites at two reserves in Essex, England, between 1990 and 1992 (Vickery et al. 1994) found that brent geese Branta bernicla grazing densities on 24 grassland plots were not affected by the frequency of grass cutting (between two and five times a year). There were no differences between areas that were only cut, cut and grazed or only grazed. This study is discussed further in ‘Fertilise grasslands’ and ‘Employ grazing in natural and semi-natural habitats’.A series of replicated controlled trials on grassland sites at two reserves in Essex, England, between 1990 and 1992 (Vickery et al. 1994) found that brent geese Branta bernicla did not graze at higher densities on plots that were areas grazed, compared to cut and grazed areas, or areas that were just cut.

There were no differences between trials using organic and inorganic fertilizer.A randomised, replicated, controlled experiment in 1990-1992 on a pasture in Essex, UK (Vickery et al. 1994) found similar grazing intensities of brent geese Branta bernicla (pests) on sheep-grazed plots (averaging 31.6-39.5 total goose droppings/m²/winter), cut and grazed plots (28.2-36.4 droppings), and cut-only plots (28.5-36.8 droppings). The amount of vegetation was similar between grazed (223-236 g dry weight/m²), cut and grazed (195-255 g/m²) and cut-only plots (188-232 g/m²). In another randomised, replicated, controlled experiment, grazing intensities of brent geese were similar in sheep-grazed (59.6 total droppings/m²) and cattle-grazed (60.2 droppings/m²) plots. In the first experiment, grazed plots contained sheep in April-May or June and July-September and grazing intensities varied from 13.5-92.2 livestock unit days. Cut and grazed plots were cut on 26 June then grazed for one or two one-month periods. Cut plots were cut in late June and late August. Each treatment was replicated six times in 100 x 75 m plots. In the second experiment six plots (of 50 x 50 m) were grazed by 14 cattle and six plots were grazed by 6-11 sheep in June-August. Goose droppings were monitored in sample areas (with 1.5 m-radiuses) at 5 and 10 random points/plot (first and second experiments, respectively).A series of replicated controlled trials on grassland sites at two reserves in Essex, England, between 1990 and 1992 (Vickery et al. 1994) found that brent geese Branta bernicla grazed at significantly higher densities on fertilised and cut areas, compared to unfertilised areas, but only at high levels of fertiliser application (50 kg N/ha used: 28-30 droppings/m2 for fertilised areas vs. 23-28 droppings/m2 for controls; 18 kg N/ha\\xa0 used: 30-35 droppings/m2 for fertilised areas vs. 25-35 droppings/m2 for control areas).
